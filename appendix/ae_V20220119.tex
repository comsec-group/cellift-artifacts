\subsection{Description}

{\em Obligatory. For inapplicable subsections (e.g., the ``How to access'' subsection when not applying for the ``Artifacts Available'' badge), please specify 'N/A'.}

\subsubsection{How to access}

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

\subsubsection{Data sets}

\subsubsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Security, privacy, and ethical concerns}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Installation}

{\em Obligatory. Describe the setup procedures for your artifact targeting novice users (even if you use a VM image or access to a remote machine).}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment workflow}

{\em Describe the high-level view of your experimental workflow and how it is implemented, invoked and customized (if needed), i.e. some OS scripts, IPython/Jupyter notebook, portable CK workflow, etc. This subsection is optional as long as the experiment workflow can be easily embedded in the next subsection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}

{\em Obligatory. Start by listing the main claims in your paper. Next, list your key results and detail how they each support the main claims. Finally, detail all the steps to reproduce each of the key results in your paper by running the artifacts. Describe the expected results and the maximum variation of empirical results (particularly important for performance numbers).}
